# Dentist-App

A simple application written in C# and using SQL Data bases.
This app was developed during my final year of high school. Its purpose is to help a dental clinic, or even a single doctor to schedule their/his pacients.

There is also an "administrator account" that can be accesed using the username "administrator" and the password "admin123".

Warning! The app won't work on your computer because all the connectionstrings point to my local database.
